# Architecture Reference Documents

Valuable architecture documents providing detailed analysis, patterns, and design explorations. These documents contain important information but are not currently linked from the main architecture-overview.md.

## Component Architecture

- **[Component Interactions](./COMPONENT_INTERACTIONS.md)** - Component interaction patterns and data flows
- **[Case Persistence System Design](./case-persistence-system-design.md)** - Complete technical design for case persistence, Redis implementation, service integration (1777 lines)
- **[Case-Agent Integration Design](./CASE_AGENT_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md)** - Integration architecture between case management and agent system

## Infrastructure & Layers

- **[Infrastructure Layer Guide](./infrastructure-layer-guide.md)** - Comprehensive infrastructure layer guide
- **[Architectural Layers](./architectural-layers.md)** - Layer architecture and responsibilities

## Design Analysis

- **[Context Engineering Analysis](./CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_ANALYSIS.md)** - Context management analysis and patterns
- **[Conversational Interaction Model](./CONVERSATIONAL_INTERACTION_MODEL_DESIGN.md)** - Interaction model design exploration
- **[Detailed System Design](./faultmaven_system_detailed_design.md)** - Comprehensive system design documentation

## Framework Variants

- **[Agentic Framework Architecture](./AGENTIC_FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Alternative framework view (review if duplicate of agentic-framework-design-specification.md)

## Purpose

These documents provide:
- **Deeper dives** into specific architecture areas
- **Alternative perspectives** on system design
- **Detailed analysis** that complements main documentation
- **Reference material** for specific implementation questions

## Integration

These documents may be:
- Referenced from architecture-overview.md in future updates
- Integrated into main architecture documents
- Used as supplementary reading for specific topics
