# FaultMaven

## 🚀 Introduction
FaultMaven is an **AI-powered troubleshooting assistant** designed for **Engineers, SREs, and DevOps professionals**. It operates as a **browser-integrated companion**, dynamically analyzing logs, observability data, and incident reports to provide **real-time insights and guided troubleshooting**.

By leveraging AI-driven analysis and contextual awareness, FaultMaven **accelerates incident resolution**, minimizes **manual effort**, and enhances **reliability engineering workflows**.

## ✨ Key Features
✔ **AI-Driven Troubleshooting** – Provides **real-time recommendations** based on logs, metrics, and contextual analysis.  
✔ **Dynamic Query Handling** – Supports **query-only**, **data-only**, and **combined** troubleshooting scenarios.  
✔ **Log & Metrics Analysis** – Extracts key patterns and anomalies from structured and unstructured observability data.  
✔ **AI-Assisted vs. Manual Control** – Users have full control over AI involvement in troubleshooting.  
✔ **Session-Based Continuous Learning** – Adapts troubleshooting recommendations based on session interactions.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
FaultMaven is designed with a **monolithic deployment model** (for MVP) with **modular components** that can later be scaled into microservices.

### 🎯 Core Components
- **Adaptive Query Handler** – Interprets user input and routes queries accordingly.
- **Log & Metrics Analysis Module** – Extracts patterns and anomalies from observability data.
- **AI Troubleshooting Module** – Generates guided troubleshooting recommendations.
- **Continuous Learning Module** – Improves AI suggestions dynamically within a session.
- **Unified API Server** – Serves FastAPI endpoints and integrates AI processing.
