# --- End of requirements ---

# Recommendation: For more reproducible builds, consider using a tool like
# 'pip-tools' (pip-compile) or Poetry to generate fully pinned dependencies ('==')
# based on these requirements. Example using pip-compile:
#   pip install pip-tools
#   pip-compile requirements.txt > requirements.lock # Or keep as requirements.txt
# Then install using:
#   pip install -r requirements.lock # Or requirements.txt if overwriting
